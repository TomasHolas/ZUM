# Assignment:

The Wanderers
We have a maze (e.g. a grid map) and in it are placed the mazes. To do this, we have a group of robots that have the task of collecting the mazes. Each robot carries only one maze. For simplicity, we can ignore collisions between robots. Somewhere on the map is the collection point for the wandering robots.

* It is possible to solve for different variants, for example the locations of the wanderers are known in advance or not. The robots share information about the discovered wanderers or not.
* We would like to collect as many mazes as possible in the shortest time. You can compete with another team of robots to collect them.
